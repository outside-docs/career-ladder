## Scope

I increasingly influence the roadmaps of other teams to achieve business impacting goals. I exercise judgement that favors the priorities of the wider engineering org rather than favoring locally optimal outcomes.

## Collaboration and Communication

- I listen and guide debates to help reach a commitment, and follow it up by documenting and reinforcing team decisions.
- I create opportunities that share knowledge to upskill team members across the entire department. 
- I multiply the effectiveness of others by facilitating cross-team, multi-disciplinary work. 

## Planning, Prioritization and Architecture

- I scope and stage work into well-defined milestones that avoid monolithic deliverables.
- I look ahead 6-12 months, identify the areas of greatest need and create plans to improve them.

## Technical Contributions

- I lead solution discovery and execution across multiple project domains in coordination with business stakeholders.
- I research, propose and implement new technology, tools and/or processes that improve productivity, code quality, and/or business opportunities.
- I create sweeping improvements in stability, performance, and scalability across major business-critical systems.
- I design and lead major architectural changes. 
- I identify and proactively address tech debt before it requires significant investment to resolve. 

## Debugging & Monitoring
