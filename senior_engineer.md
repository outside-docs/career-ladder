## Scope
I increasingly optimize beyond just my team by driving cross-team or cross-discipline initiatives - owning work in and adjacent to my primary domain

## Collaboration and Communication
- Communicates effectively with immediate and dependent teams and stakeholders
- Communicates with the organization, helps others in team to communicate
- Attends and/or facilitates meetings with stakeholders to gather or ask technical questions without reliance on EM or PM
- Communicates technical concepts to non-technical audiences

## Planning, Prioritization and Architecture
- Authors technical solution planning artifacts (ie. RFCs, Design Diagrams)
- Provides reliable estimates based off of tech debt, project priorities
- Understands competing priorities and acts accordingly
- Design solutions (of z complexity) that are aligned with the overall architecture
- Assists with technical discovery during planning to reduce ambiguity
- Influences product roadmap by bringing technical insight and aligning engineering priorities with business goals

## Technical Contributions
- Develops coding best practices for the team and utilizes automation where possible to enforce best practices
- Manages, contributes, and performs upkeep on unit tests & E2E tests
- Writes code review feedback that is timely, sought after and respected, and often the source of othersâ€™ learning
- Subject matter expert of 1 or more codebases
- Owns documentation for complex systems, drives standards for how the team documents services, and ensures technical decisions are well recorded
- Begins to delegate tasks, or pair programs on tasks for the purpose of knowledge sharing with other engineers

## Debugging & Monitoring
- Debugs the toughest issues. Capable of weighing solutions against constraints
- Strategizes the full cycle of monitoring from alerting, metrics, monitors, and tooling for at least 1 system
- Improves the culture of debugging by utilizing debugging as a growth mechanism for less experienced developers

## Example activity breakdown
- 60% - Facilitate, Create and Design Solutions with Code
